# 👋 Hi, I’m Rajesh Lingam  
**AI Evaluation Engineer | DevOps & MLOps Specialist | Judge & Mentor | IEEE Senior Member**

I build **large-scale AI Evaluation Systems** that combine automation, quality engineering, and real-world impact.  
Over 20+ years in the industry (DevOps → MLOps → AI Evaluation), I’ve delivered platforms that run thousands of automated workflows, power enterprise-grade GenAI features, and support cross-functional teams globally.

## 🚀 What I Work On
- **AI Evaluation Platform And Enterprise Applications(Adobe)**  
  End-to-end automation for GenAI Q&A evaluation using **Prefect, Databricks, W&B**, and scalable metric validation.  
  Includes baseline validation, batch flow execution, zero-click evaluation, and quality-gates.

- **Agentic AI & Hackathon Projects**  
  I actively prototype agentic AI solutions using **LangGraph, LangChain, NIM**, and evaluate them with FastPass.  
  Recent project: *AgentJarvis – AI Personal Evaluation Assistant* (EKS + NVIDIA NIM).

## 🎤 Talks, Judging & Mentoring
I regularly participate as a **judge, mentor, or reviewer** at academic and developer events.

**Highlights:**  
- IEEE Senior Member  
- Reviewer for multiple tech conferences  
- Hackathon judge/mentor (MIT/Harvard/Princeton–style university events)  
- Speaker on GenAI evaluation, MLOps, and agentic AI systems  

If you’re looking for a mentor, reviewer, or community speaker — I’m happy to connect.
